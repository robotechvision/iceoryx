/// @brief pointer class to use when pointer and pointee are located in different shared memory segments
/// We can have the following scenario:
/// Pointer p is stored in segment S1 and points to object X of type T in segment S2.
///
/// Shared Memory   S1:  p              S2:  X
///                      |___________________^
/// App1            a1   b1             c1   d1
/// App2            a2   b2             c2   d2
///
/// Now it is no longer true in general that both segments will be offset by the same difference in App2 and therefore
/// relocatable pointers are no longer sufficient.
/// Relative pointers solve this problem by incorporating the information from where they need to measure differences
/// (i.e. relative to the given address). This requires an additional registration mechanism to be used by all
/// applications where the start addresses and the size of all segments to be used are registered. Since these start
/// address may differ between applications, each segment is identified by a unique id, which can be provided upon
/// registration by the first application. In the figure, this means that the starting addresses of both segments(a1, a2
/// and c1, c2) would have to be registered in both applications.
/// Once this registration is done, relative pointers can be constructed from raw pointers similar to relocatable
/// pointers.
/// @note It should be noted that relocating a memory segment will invalidate relative pointers, i.e. relative pointers
/// are NOT relocatable. This is because the registration mechanism cannot be automatically informed about the copy of a
/// whole segment, such a segment would have to be registered on its own (and the original segment deregistered).
